# Unlocked
First GitHub Repository
Hello there! I am new to GitHub and to programming...
I am 33 years old guy with no programming background, who decided to bet on a change of carreer.
Started in February 2015 a full course in Java. Once completed the course (assuming I'll be able to do it...), I'll be an "Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer", then a "Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 7 Programmer" and finally a "Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Web Component Developer". 
My objective here is to learn the most as it is possible and to get help and inspiration from you programming Gods out there! 
I have a project in wich I need some ideas and some help... Details soon...
Thanks in advance!
